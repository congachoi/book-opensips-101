OpenSIPS by design is not allowed to alter media at all.
Therefore we need a media gateway should we want to route our subscriber calls to other network such as PSTN, vice versa.

The topology is relatively simple. We have OpenSIPS controlling SIP messages and media gateway to control media, audio and/or video.

For this exercise we will use [http://www.asterisk.org/ Asterisk].

Install Asterisk on the same server as OpenSIPS:

 apt-get install asterisk

Please note that both OpenSIPS and Asterisk will occupy the same UDP port 5060. We need to change this, we need to configure in such a way that
OpenSIPS will stay in default port 5060 and Asterisk in another port, for example 5090.

To be continue..
