First step is to download attached file from master repo:<br>
https://github.com/antonraharja/book-opensips-101/tree/master/attached-files/5.3

Save those files locally and then upload them to your opensips-cp server. Put in /var/www/cp/config/tools/system/cdrviewer/ to replace existing files.

For example we uploaded those files to home directory /home/anton:

 cd /home/anton
 ls -l local* *.mysql
 cp local.inc.php cdrs.mysql opensips_cdrs.mysql /var/www/cp/config/tools/system/cdrviewer/

Please note that attached files are modified from opensips-cp original files, added to them a way to save src_uri and dst_uri from acc table, thus making current opensips-cp capable of displaying Source and Destination.

Setup database for CDRviewer:

 cd /var/www/cp/config/tools/system/cdrviewer/
 mysql -uroot -p opensips < cdrs.mysql
 mysql -uroot -p opensips < opensips_cdrs.mysql

Create this directory for cron job script to dump the file:

 mkdir -p /var/lib/opensips_cdrs

Setup cron job scripts for opensips-cp, including the one to generate CDRs:

 cd /root/src/opensips/5.0/cron_job
 cp generate-cdrs_mysql.sh /usr/local/sbin/

Edit ''generate-cdrs_mysql.sh'', update database options according to our database server setups. While doing this you need to also make sure that the mysql command line in that file is like this:

 mysql -h $HOSTNAME -u $USER -p$PASS -e "call opensips_cdrs(); " $DATABASE

Please note the stored procedure name, it must be ''opensips_cdrs()'', change it if its not:

 vi /usr/local/sbin/generate-cdrs_mysql.sh

Update cron and insert generate-cdrs_mysql.sh:

 crontab -e

Fill cron file with this:

 */15 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/generate-cdrs_mysql.sh

Above example will get ''generate-cdrs_mysql.sh'' to run every 15 minutes.

Login to opensips-cp web GUI and view CDRviewer menu in System tab.
